# private-blockchain
Blockchain Implementation in python using Flask for setting up the node. I am using Proof of Work as the protocol. 
# Inspiration
I have been actively involved in the blockchain community for quite some time. To look at blockchain from a technical perspective and learn how it works ground up, I worked on this project. I would like to thank Daniel for this article here:https://hackernoon.com/learn-blockchains-by-building-one-117428612f46 which helped me throughout the process. 

# How to run it?
You can run the flask app by simply running ``` python node.py```. This basically runs a flask server as a node on the blockchain, and you can make GET and POST requests to this node to get information to/from blockchain.
